2. Paste Script

Info about the script data:
"original": The original file you want to replace, a must have.
"replace": The new file you want to replace with, a must have.
"current": Current file name in your pack, if you previously changed an item and want to change to something different. First object from array is an example. Optional.
"single": This will not duplicate the name file, is good when you want to replace skins. Example in the data I gave you. Optional.

6. Open MinGW Bash or Git Bash by right clicking if missing, go to where you installed MinGW, open the file (i have Git Bash, don't know exactly), type cd d: if you have it installed somewhere else then cd "{path of fortnite Packs}"

7. Paste the command generated in DevTools.

8. Wait from 5 to 10 minutes, depends on how many you changed, if 2-3 changed might be 2-3 minutes, 10 changes 6-7 minutes.
